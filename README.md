## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Unix/Linux/macOS bash shell (or WSL on Windows)
- Basic understanding of command line

### How to Use

1. **Start with Groupe-0** and work through each job sequentially
2. **Each job file contains** shell command examples and their descriptions
3. **Practice by:** Executing the commands and understanding their output
4. **Move to the next level** once you understand all commands in the current group

Example:
```bash
cd groupe-0
cat job00.txt  # View the exercise
# Try the commands in your shell
```

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Read the description first** - Each command line includes a French explanation
2. **Type it out** - Don't just read, execute commands to learn muscle memory
3. **Experiment** - Try variations of commands to understand their behavior
4. **Progress gradually** - Don't rush through levels
5. **Combine commands** - Practice piping different commands together

## 🔧 Technologies
