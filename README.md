# BTP Cardio 💪

A comprehensive collection of **shell command exercises** organized by difficulty level. This repository contains progressive lessons in bash/shell scripting fundamentals, perfect for learning and practicing command-line operations.

## 📚 Project Overview

**BTP Cardio** is designed as a "cardio" (workout) for your command-line skills. Each group contains exercises that progressively build your shell command proficiency, from basic navigation to file manipulation and system operations.

## 🎯 Learning Path

### **Groupe-0: Fundamentals** (Beginner)
Master the basic shell commands:
- Directory navigation (`pwd`, `cd`)
- File viewing and copying (`cp`, `cat`)
- Output redirection (`>`, `>>`)
- Process listing and filtering (`ps`, `tail`, `wc`)

### **Groupe-1: Intermediate** (Intermediate)
Build on fundamentals:
- File creation and modification
- Stream redirection and piping
- Text processing
- Command chaining

### **Groupe-2: Advanced** (Advanced)
Develop professional shell skills:
- System information queries
- Process analysis
- Complex command piping
- Text manipulation & analysis

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Unix/Linux/macOS bash shell (or WSL on Windows)
- Basic understanding of command line

### How to Use

1. **Start with Groupe-0** and work through each job sequentially
2. **Each job file contains** shell command examples and their descriptions
3. **Practice by:** Executing the commands and understanding their output
4. **Move to the next level** once you understand all commands in the current group

Example:
```bash
cd groupe-0
cat job00.txt  # View the exercise
# Try the commands in your shell
```

## 📖 Command Reference by Group

- File creation and modification
- Text processing basics

### Groupe-2 Commands
- Advanced process analysis
- System information extraction

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Read the description first** - Each command line includes a French explanation
2. **Type it out** - Don't just read, execute commands to learn muscle memory
3. **Experiment** - Try variations of commands to understand their behavior
4. **Progress gradually** - Don't rush through levels
5. **Combine commands** - Practice piping different commands together
